This project is a implementation of a "Rent A Car " API in GOLANG. It uses Gin framework as web framework and PostgreSql as database. The code is fully covered by tests, using Jest.

Most of the backend side of the application has been completed, but there are still some shortcomings. These deficiencies are quickly corrected.

After most of the backend processes are finished, frontend work is also planned to take place.
